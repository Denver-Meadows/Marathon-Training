       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>My name is Denver Meadows and I'm a 37 year old aspiring web
     developer.  I got my start with programming learning Python.  Using Python,
     I learned all the basics of programming.  I also took some introductory
     courses into computer science to have a baseline understanding.  After 6
     months of learning Python, I started experimenting with Django to build a
     website.  That opened my eyes to the world of frontend development.  After
     some research I decided to focus all my time on frontend web dev and would
     start my career there.  Ultimately, my goal is to come full circle and
     get back into Python on the backend to complete the full stack. <br> <br>
         Before I jumped straight to HTML, I took courses on the MacOS command
         line, GIT and GitHUb.  Once I was comfortable with the command line and
         the basic Git workflow, I started with Codecademy to learn HTML. During
         this time I was also training to run my first full marathon.  This gave
         me the inspiration to create a website and track my progress. So I'm
     simultaneously learning HTML, Git, GitHub and solidifying my command line
     knowledge.  I plan to continue letting the website evolve as my skills
     improve.  Join me on my journey!</p>
